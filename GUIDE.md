# Launch Academy Code Review Guide

**Note:** If you are looking for feedback on a small selection of code or a snippet out of context, please use the `#coding-questions` channel which exists for that purpose.

## About
The `#code-review` channel is intended for people looking to submit full scripts or projects for a formal peer-review process, as well as those interested in volunteering their time to offer constructive feedback on others' code.

## Process
There are a number of tools already out there for code review, but many require creating new accounts and don't integrate directly with Github. Github itself has a great review system built-in, but currently only supports adding comments on commits or pull requests. If you want to request a review on an individual commit or PR, you can post the link in Slack and the entire review process can take place on Github. However, if you wish to submit a whole repo or a single file from a repo, please follow the following guidelines.

### Submitting code for review
Post a link on Slack to the file on Github with a short description of what the code is and what you would like the reviewer(s) to focus on. Done!

### Reviewing other's code
For an individual comment, post a Github link with the relevant line number or range added to the end of the URL as well as the content of your comment:

Single line: https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/lib/assert.js#L86

Multiple lines: https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/lib/assert.js#L86-L89

## Etiquette
Please treat this forum as you would a professional work environment. Comport yourself accordingly.

## Final Note
The process outlined above is a work in progress. We are open to recommendations as to how we can simplify and improve it in the future, but for now please follow these guidelines as best you can.
